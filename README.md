# Grocery list API (grocerylist-api)

#### A personal use project and knowledge showcase, using Docker, C# net core, ReactJs, Scss, MongoDb and Redis.

### To run

Use this docker-compose: [compose-prod.yml](https://github.com/kaiqueqg/grocerylist-api/blob/main/compose-prod.yml)

- Api address: "http://ip-computer-running-api:5000/api"

### To use on cellphone 

It was only tested **for now**, on my device with a screen of 1080 x 2280 pixels, 19:9 ratio (~438 ppi density).

[GroceryListApp.apk](https://github.com/kaiqueqg/grocerylist-app/blob/main/apk/GroceryListApp.apk)

### Explanation

###### Why?

- I made this project because I was using Google Keep to help with my grocery list but it lack some features that would help me as a user e.g. :
  - Easy to use categories, not complicated like other apps and not easy to mess like pulling the item to the side(tab) like Keep.
  - On Keep, you need to get inside the setting to change the "move to bottom when checked". I needed a easy access button for that.
  - A "locking" mechanism to inhibit unwanted changes to the list when using the phone.

###### How?

- The tools and choices are not exactly to best for the job, but more of what I wanted to learn or practice. Some patterns or frameworks may be overkill, others may be unnecessary.
